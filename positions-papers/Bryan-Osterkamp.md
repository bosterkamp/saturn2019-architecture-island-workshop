# Bryan Osterkamp - Architecture Island Position Paper

Ahoy matey!  I'm super excited to be joining everyone on Architecture Island!

This will be a very tricky packing job.  I'm normally a very thorough packer, so I'll have to keep it succinct.  

Let's see, what to pack first...

My favorite architecture book by far is
* Software Architecture in Practice 3rd Edition

Other notable books that I would say are must haves...
* 12 Essential Skills for Software Architects
* DevOps: A Software Architect's Perspective

Oh, and perhaps the most important thing of all, that I don't have to pack is my collective knowledge and experience over the past 15+ years.  One can't forget that learning lessons the hard way is perhaps one of the best teachers of all.  There is nothing like being in the midst of a problem and having to claw your way out of it.  The mentors that I have had over the years have also passed along quite a bit of knowledge.

Other important things to pack:
* Humility
* Trust
* Curiousity
* A desire to learn

## My Philosophy

My philosophy as an architect has changed over the past 5+ years that I have been an architect.  I recently found a theory called the Dunning-Kruger effect:(https://i0.wp.com/digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dunning-kruger-effect.png?zoom=2&resize=2010%2C1340&ssl=1) that describes my journey very well.

Wikipedia describes this effect as follows: 
> In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is.

When I first became an architect, I really didn't know that much as it relates to architecture.  Most of my philosophy came from on the job training or learning by fire.  Therefore, my approach reflected that.  I didn't have formal training in architecture, so my philosophy was do what felt right and had worked before.  I also used my "spidey sense" to know if an approach just didn't "feel right."  This actually suited me pretty well.  The first part of the Dunning-Kruger effect is when someone's confidence is much higher than their competence.   I was making decisions to the best of my ability, but in a role that 

### What not to pack
Perhaps even more important would be things not to pack.

* Arrogance
* Historical bias (assuming something that worked in the past must work now, or something that didn't work in the past won't work now... even if it is a completely different situation or context)
